# ABlasianSnapMod
Me playing around with Marvel Snap.

Although this is a public repo, this isn't quite ready for public use. 
#How To Use
This code can be compiled as a DLL usable with MelonLoader. Just install MelonLoader onto your copy of Marvel Snap (PC Only) and place the compiled DLL into the mods folder of your installation.
#Compiling
I originally started developping this in Visual Studio 2022 and so I recommend using this version to compile the code.
